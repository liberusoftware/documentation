# Accounts Payable: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-accounting-accounts-payable`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-accounting-accounts-payable-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/accounts-payable.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **2 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-accounting-accounts-payable](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-accounting-accounts-payable.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-accounting-accounts-payable-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-accounting-accounts-payable-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Supplier subledger | A focused authorized view or workflow section for supplier subledger; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Open items | A focused authorized view or workflow section for open items; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Aging | A focused authorized view or workflow section for aging; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Balances | A focused authorized view or workflow section for balances; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Credits | A focused authorized view or workflow section for credits; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Disputes | A focused authorized view or workflow section for disputes; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Holds | A focused authorized view or workflow section for holds; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Payment terms | A focused authorized view or workflow section for payment terms; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Control-account reconciliation | A focused authorized view or workflow section for control-account reconciliation; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

These are observed PHP query entry points, not assumed HTTP endpoints. Use an owning API adapter to authorize and serialize their results.

| Source query | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [AgingQuery.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Queries/AgingQuery.php) | `public function handle(?int $partyId = null, ?\DateTimeInterface $asOf = null): array` |
| [ControlAccountReconciliationQuery.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Queries/ControlAccountReconciliationQuery.php) | `public function handle(): array` |
| [SupplierSubledgerQuery.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Queries/SupplierSubledgerQuery.php) | `public function handle(int $partyId): array` |

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [ApplyPayment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Actions/ApplyPayment.php) | `public function handle(PayablePayment $payment, PayableOpenItem $item, float $amount): PayablePayment` |
| [CreateOpenItem.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Actions/CreateOpenItem.php) | `public function handle(array $attributes): PayableOpenItem` |
| [EnsureAccount.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Actions/EnsureAccount.php) | `public function handle(int $partyId): PayableAccount` |
| [OpenDispute.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Actions/OpenDispute.php) | `public function handle(PayableOpenItem $item, string $reason, ?float $amount = null): PayableDispute` |
| [RecalculateAccountBalance.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Actions/RecalculateAccountBalance.php) | `public function handle(int $partyId): PayableAccount` |
| [RecordPayment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Actions/RecordPayment.php) | `public function handle(array $attributes): PayablePayment` |
| [ResolveDispute.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Actions/ResolveDispute.php) | `public function handle(PayableDispute $dispute, string $resolution, bool $accepted = false): PayableDispute` |
| [SetPaymentControl.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Actions/SetPaymentControl.php) | `public function handle(int $partyId, ?bool $paymentHold = null, ?string $holdReason = null): PayableAccount` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [PayableAccount.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Models/PayableAccount.php) | `party_id`, `current_balance`, `payment_hold`, `hold_reason`, `control_account_code`, `status`, `metadata` |
| [PayableDispute.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Models/PayableDispute.php) | `open_item_id`, `amount`, `reason`, `status`, `opened_at`, `resolved_at`, `resolution`, `metadata` |
| [PayableOpenItem.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Models/PayableOpenItem.php) | `party_id`, `source_type`, `source_id`, `reference`, `issued_on`, `due_on`, `original_amount`, `paid_amount`, `currency`, `payment_terms`, `status`, `metadata` |
| [PayablePayment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Models/PayablePayment.php) | `party_id`, `paid_on`, `amount`, `applied_amount`, `currency`, `reference`, `status`, `metadata` |
| [PaymentApplication.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable/src/Models/PaymentApplication.php) | `payment_id`, `open_item_id`, `amount` |

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/accounting-accounts-payable-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-accounts-payable-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::prefix('api/v1/accounting/accounts-payable')->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'throttle:60,1'])->group(function (): void {
Route::middleware('ability:accounting.payables.read')->group(function (): void {
Route::get('/', [PayableOpenItemController::class, 'index']);
Route::get('/aging', [PayableOpenItemController::class, 'aging']);
Route::get('/balances/{party}', [PayableOpenItemController::class, 'balances']);
Route::get('/reconciliation', [PayableOpenItemController::class, 'reconcile']);
Route::get('/open-items/{payableOpenItem}', [PayableOpenItemController::class, 'show']);
Route::middleware('ability:accounting.payables.write')->group(function (): void {
Route::post('/open-items', [PayableOpenItemController::class, 'store']);
Route::post('/payments', [PayableOpenItemController::class, 'payment']);
Route::post('/payments/{payment}/apply', [PayableOpenItemController::class, 'apply']);
Route::post('/disputes', [PayableOpenItemController::class, 'dispute']);
Route::post('/disputes/{dispute}/resolve', [PayableOpenItemController::class, 'resolve']);
Route::post('/suppliers/{party}/payment-control', [PayableOpenItemController::class, 'paymentControl']);
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.

See the [Next.js standard](../../../standards/NEXTJS.md), [npm lifecycle guide](../../../guides/NPM.md), [API architecture](../../../architecture/API.md), and [shared ownership guide](../../../architecture/SHARED-MODULES.md).
