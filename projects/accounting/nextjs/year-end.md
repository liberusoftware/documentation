# Year End: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-accounting-year-end`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-accounting-year-end-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/year-end.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **2 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-accounting-year-end](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-accounting-year-end.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-accounting-year-end-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-accounting-year-end-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Final adjustments | A focused authorized view or workflow section for final adjustments; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Retained earnings/roll-forward | A focused authorized view or workflow section for retained earnings/roll-forward; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Opening balances | A focused authorized view or workflow section for opening balances; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Statutory/tax handoff | A focused authorized view or workflow section for statutory/tax handoff; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Lock | A focused authorized view or workflow section for lock; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Archive | A focused authorized view or workflow section for archive; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Evidence | A focused authorized view or workflow section for evidence; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

These are observed PHP query entry points, not assumed HTTP endpoints. Use an owning API adapter to authorize and serialize their results.

| Source query | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [YearEndQuery.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end/src/Queries/YearEndQuery.php) | `public function forTeam(int $teamId): Collection` |

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [AddYearEndAdjustment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end/src/Actions/AddYearEndAdjustment.php) | `public function handle(YearEndPeriod $period, array $attributes): YearEndAdjustment` |
| [ArchiveYearEnd.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end/src/Actions/ArchiveYearEnd.php) | `public function handle(YearEndPeriod $period): YearEndPeriod` |
| [CloseYearEnd.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end/src/Actions/CloseYearEnd.php) | `public function handle(YearEndClose $close, string $closingEntryRef): YearEndClose` |
| [CreateYearEndClose.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end/src/Actions/CreateYearEndClose.php) | `public function handle(array $attributes): YearEndClose` |
| [CreateYearEndPeriod.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end/src/Actions/CreateYearEndPeriod.php) | `public function handle(array $attributes): YearEndPeriod` |
| [LockYearEnd.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end/src/Actions/LockYearEnd.php) | `public function handle(YearEndPeriod $period, int $actor): YearEndPeriod` |
| [ReopenYearEnd.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end/src/Actions/ReopenYearEnd.php) | `public function handle(YearEndClose $close): YearEndClose` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [YearEndAdjustment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end/src/Models/YearEndAdjustment.php) | `period_id`, `team_id`, `adjustment_ref`, `amount`, `description`, `journal_ref`, `status`, `evidence` |
| [YearEndClose.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end/src/Models/YearEndClose.php) | `team_id`, `fiscal_year`, `period_end`, `retained_earnings_account_ref`, `net_income`, `status`, `closed_at`, `locked_at`, `closing_entry_ref`, `metadata` |
| [YearEndPeriod.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end/src/Models/YearEndPeriod.php) | `team_id`, `period_ref`, `period_end`, `status`, `retained_earnings`, `opening_balances`, `statutory_handoff`, `evidence`, `locked_by`, `locked_at`, `archived_at` |

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/accounting-year-end-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/accounting-erp-laravel/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-year-end-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::prefix('api/v1/accounting/year-end')->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'throttle:60,1'])->group(function (): void {
Route::middleware('ability:accounting.year-end.read')->get('/', [YearEndController::class, 'index']);
Route::middleware('ability:accounting.year-end.write')->group(function (): void {
Route::post('/', [YearEndController::class, 'store']);
Route::post('/{period}/adjustments', [YearEndController::class, 'adjustment']);
Route::post('/{period}/lock', [YearEndController::class, 'lock']);
Route::post('/{period}/archive', [YearEndController::class, 'archive']);
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.
