# Document Capture: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-accounting-document-capture`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-accounting-document-capture-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/document-capture.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **2 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-accounting-document-capture](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-accounting-document-capture.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-accounting-document-capture-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-accounting-document-capture-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Mobile/web/email upload | A focused authorized view or workflow section for mobile/web/email upload; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| OCR/extraction adapters | A focused authorized view or workflow section for ocr/extraction adapters; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Supplier matching | A focused authorized view or workflow section for supplier matching; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Line/tax capture | A focused authorized view or workflow section for line/tax capture; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Confidence | A focused authorized view or workflow section for confidence; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Duplicate checks | A focused authorized view or workflow section for duplicate checks; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Review | A focused authorized view or workflow section for review; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Source retention | A focused authorized view or workflow section for source retention; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

These are observed PHP query entry points, not assumed HTTP endpoints. Use an owning API adapter to authorize and serialize their results.

| Source query | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [CaptureQuery.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-document-capture/src/Queries/CaptureQuery.php) | `public function paginate(?int $teamId = null, ?CaptureStatus $status = null, int $perPage = 25): LengthAwarePaginator` |

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [ArchiveDocument.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-document-capture/src/Actions/ArchiveDocument.php) | `public function handle(CapturedDocument $d, ?string $actor = null): CapturedDocument` |
| [ExtractDocument.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-document-capture/src/Actions/ExtractDocument.php) | `public function handle(CapturedDocument $d, array $extracted, float $confidence, string $adapter, ?string $actor = null): CapturedDocument` |
| [MarkDuplicateDocument.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-document-capture/src/Actions/MarkDuplicateDocument.php) | `public function handle(CapturedDocument $d, CapturedDocument $original, ?string $actor = null): CapturedDocument` |
| [ReviewDocument.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-document-capture/src/Actions/ReviewDocument.php) | `public function handle(CapturedDocument $d, bool $approved, ?string $reason = null, ?string $actor = null): CapturedDocument` |
| [UploadDocument.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-document-capture/src/Actions/UploadDocument.php) | `public function handle(array $a): CapturedDocument` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [CaptureEvent.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-document-capture/src/Models/CaptureEvent.php) | `document_id`, `event`, `actor_ref`, `adapter_ref`, `message`, `metadata` |
| [CapturedDocument.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-document-capture/src/Models/CapturedDocument.php) | `team_id`, `source_channel`, `file_ref`, `checksum`, `mime_type`, `status`, `supplier_ref`, `document_ref`, `extracted_data`, `confidence`, `duplicate_of`, `retention_until`, `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`, `rejection_reason`, `metadata` |
| [Document.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-document-capture-api/src/Models/Document.php) | `documentable_type`, `documentable_id`, `name`, `disk`, `retention_until`, `team_id` |

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/accounting-document-capture-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-document-capture-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::middleware(['api', 'auth:sanctum', 'throttle:api'])->prefix('api/v1/accounting/document-capture')->group(function (): void {
Route::middleware('ability:accounting.document-capture.read')->group(function (): void {
Route::get('/', [DocumentCaptureController::class, 'index']);
Route::get('/{d}', [DocumentCaptureController::class, 'show']);
Route::middleware('ability:accounting.document-capture.write')->group(function (): void {
Route::post('/', [DocumentCaptureController::class, 'store']);
Route::post('/{d}/extract', [DocumentCaptureController::class, 'extract']);
Route::post('/{d}/review', [DocumentCaptureController::class, 'review']);
Route::post('/{d}/duplicate', [DocumentCaptureController::class, 'duplicate']);
Route::post('/{d}/archive', [DocumentCaptureController::class, 'archive']);
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.
