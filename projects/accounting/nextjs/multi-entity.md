# Multi-Entity: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-accounting-multi-entity`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-accounting-multi-entity-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/multi-entity.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **2 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-accounting-multi-entity](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-accounting-multi-entity.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-accounting-multi-entity-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-accounting-multi-entity-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Entity books | A focused authorized view or workflow section for entity books; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Shared master-data policy | A focused authorized view or workflow section for shared master-data policy; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Access | A focused authorized view or workflow section for access; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Entity switching | A focused authorized view or workflow section for entity switching; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Separate periods/tax | A focused authorized view or workflow section for separate periods/tax; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Standardized mappings | A focused authorized view or workflow section for standardized mappings; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Reporting | A focused authorized view or workflow section for reporting; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

These are observed PHP query entry points, not assumed HTTP endpoints. Use an owning API adapter to authorize and serialize their results.

| Source query | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [EntityQuery.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Queries/EntityQuery.php) | `public function paginate(?int $teamId = null, ?string $status = null, int $perPage = 25): LengthAwarePaginator`<br>`public function report(EntityBook $entity): array` |

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [CreateEntityBook.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Actions/CreateEntityBook.php) | `public function handle(array $attributes): EntityBook` |
| [CreateEntityMapping.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Actions/CreateEntityMapping.php) | `public function handle(EntityBook $entity, string $type, string $source, string $target): EntityMapping` |
| [CreateEntityPeriod.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Actions/CreateEntityPeriod.php) | `public function handle(EntityBook $entity, array $attributes): EntityPeriod` |
| [GrantEntityAccess.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Actions/GrantEntityAccess.php) | `public function handle(EntityBook $entity, string $userRef, string $role, array $permissions = [], bool $default = false): EntityAccess` |
| [SetMasterDataPolicy.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Actions/SetMasterDataPolicy.php) | `public function handle(EntityBook $entity, string $key, string $mode, array $configuration = []): MasterDataPolicy` |
| [SwitchEntity.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Actions/SwitchEntity.php) | `public function handle(EntityBook $entity, string $userRef, string $sessionRef): EntitySwitch` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [EntityAccess.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Models/EntityAccess.php) | `entity_id`, `user_ref`, `role`, `permissions`, `is_default`, `metadata` |
| [EntityBook.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Models/EntityBook.php) | `team_id`, `entity_ref`, `code`, `name`, `base_currency`, `timezone`, `tax_registration`, `status`, `metadata` |
| [EntityMapping.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Models/EntityMapping.php) | `entity_id`, `mapping_type`, `source_ref`, `target_ref`, `description`, `is_active`, `metadata` |
| [EntityPeriod.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Models/EntityPeriod.php) | `entity_id`, `period_ref`, `starts_on`, `ends_on`, `tax_configuration`, `status`, `closed_by`, `closed_at`, `metadata` |
| [EntitySwitch.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Models/EntitySwitch.php) | `entity_id`, `user_ref`, `session_ref`, `switched_at`, `metadata` |
| [MasterDataPolicy.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity/src/Models/MasterDataPolicy.php) | `entity_id`, `policy_key`, `mode`, `configuration`, `metadata` |

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/accounting-multi-entity-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-multi-entity-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::middleware(['api', 'auth:sanctum', 'throttle:api'])->prefix('api/v1/accounting/multi-entity')->group(function (): void {
Route::get('/', [MultiEntityController::class, 'index'])->name('accounting.multi-entity.list');
Route::post('/', [MultiEntityController::class, 'store'])->name('accounting.multi-entity.create');
Route::get('/{entityBook}', [MultiEntityController::class, 'show'])->name('accounting.multi-entity.show');
Route::post('/{entityBook}/access', [MultiEntityController::class, 'access'])->name('accounting.multi-entity.access');
Route::post('/{entityBook}/switch', [MultiEntityController::class, 'switch'])->name('accounting.multi-entity.switch');
Route::post('/{entityBook}/periods', [MultiEntityController::class, 'period'])->name('accounting.multi-entity.period');
Route::post('/{entityBook}/policy', [MultiEntityController::class, 'policy'])->name('accounting.multi-entity.policy');
Route::post('/{entityBook}/mappings', [MultiEntityController::class, 'mapping'])->name('accounting.multi-entity.mapping');
Route::get('/{entityBook}/report', [MultiEntityController::class, 'report'])->name('accounting.multi-entity.report');
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.
