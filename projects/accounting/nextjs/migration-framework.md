# Migration Framework: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-accounting-migration-framework`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-accounting-migration-framework-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/migration-framework.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **2 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-accounting-migration-framework](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-accounting-migration-framework.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-accounting-migration-framework-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-accounting-migration-framework-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Source inventory | A focused authorized view or workflow section for source inventory; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Mapping | A focused authorized view or workflow section for mapping; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Dry run | A focused authorized view or workflow section for dry run; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Transforms | A focused authorized view or workflow section for transforms; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Validation | A focused authorized view or workflow section for validation; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Batches | A focused authorized view or workflow section for batches; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Resume | A focused authorized view or workflow section for resume; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Attachments | A focused authorized view or workflow section for attachments; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Errors | A focused authorized view or workflow section for errors; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Counts | A focused authorized view or workflow section for counts; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Reconciliation | A focused authorized view or workflow section for reconciliation; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

These are observed PHP query entry points, not assumed HTTP endpoints. Use an owning API adapter to authorize and serialize their results.

| Source query | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [MigrationQuery.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework/src/Queries/MigrationQuery.php) | `public function sources(?int $teamId = null, int $perPage = 25): LengthAwarePaginator`<br>`public function batches(?int $teamId = null, int $perPage = 25): LengthAwarePaginator`<br>`public function counts(MigrationBatch $batch): array` |

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [CreateBatch.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework/src/Actions/CreateBatch.php) | `public function handle(MigrationSource $source, MigrationMapping $mapping, array $attributes, array $rows = []): MigrationBatch` |
| [CreateMapping.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework/src/Actions/CreateMapping.php) | `public function handle(MigrationSource $source, array $attributes): MigrationMapping` |
| [ReconcileBatch.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework/src/Actions/ReconcileBatch.php) | `public function handle(MigrationBatch $batch, array $attributes = []): MigrationReconciliation` |
| [RegisterSource.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework/src/Actions/RegisterSource.php) | `public function handle(array $attributes): MigrationSource` |
| [RunBatch.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework/src/Actions/RunBatch.php) | `public function handle(MigrationBatch $batch, bool $dryRun = false, int $limit = 100): MigrationBatch` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [MigrationAttachment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework/src/Models/MigrationAttachment.php) | `batch_id`, `file_ref`, `name`, `mime_type`, `size_bytes`, `checksum`, `metadata` |
| [MigrationBatch.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework/src/Models/MigrationBatch.php) | `team_id`, `batch_ref`, `source_id`, `mapping_id`, `status`, `dry_run`, `resume_token`, `total_count`, `processed_count`, `success_count`, `error_count`, `skipped_count`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, `paused_at`, `failure_message`, `metadata` |

| [MigrationReconciliation.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework/src/Models/MigrationReconciliation.php) | `batch_id`, `source_count`, `imported_count`, `failed_count`, `source_total`, `destination_total`, `variance`, `status`, `notes`, `metadata` |
| [MigrationRow.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework/src/Models/MigrationRow.php) | `batch_id`, `row_ref`, `source_key`, `destination_key`, `payload`, `transformed_payload`, `status`, `error_code`, `error_message`, `attempts`, `processed_at`, `metadata` |
| [MigrationSource.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework/src/Models/MigrationSource.php) | `team_id`, `source_ref`, `provider`, `source_type`, `name`, `record_count`, `checksum`, `status`, `metadata` |

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/accounting-migration-framework-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-accounting-erp-laravel-filament/blob/39a49babafc0b8caf12c018abdd765f215ecf207/modules/accounting-migration-framework-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::middleware(['api', 'auth:sanctum', 'throttle:api'])->prefix('api/v1/accounting/migration-framework')->group(function (): void {
Route::get('/sources', [MigrationFrameworkController::class, 'sources'])->name('accounting.migration-framework.sources');
Route::post('/sources', [MigrationFrameworkController::class, 'source'])->name('accounting.migration-framework.source');
Route::post('/sources/{source}/mappings', [MigrationFrameworkController::class, 'mapping'])->name('accounting.migration-framework.mapping');
Route::get('/batches', [MigrationFrameworkController::class, 'batches'])->name('accounting.migration-framework.batches');
Route::post('/sources/{source}/batches', [MigrationFrameworkController::class, 'batch'])->name('accounting.migration-framework.batch');
Route::post('/batches/{batch}/dry-run', [MigrationFrameworkController::class, 'dryRun'])->name('accounting.migration-framework.dry-run');
Route::post('/batches/{batch}/resume', [MigrationFrameworkController::class, 'resume'])->name('accounting.migration-framework.resume');
Route::post('/batches/{batch}/reconcile', [MigrationFrameworkController::class, 'reconcile'])->name('accounting.migration-framework.reconcile');
Route::get('/batches/{batch}/counts', [MigrationFrameworkController::class, 'counts'])->name('accounting.migration-framework.counts');
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.
