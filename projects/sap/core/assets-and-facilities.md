# Assets and facilities: core composition design

**Status:** proposed enterprise implementation. The [current SAP foundation](../SOURCE-APPLICATION.md) does not establish these business workflows or this presentation as implemented. Use the [detailed domain contract](../design/assets-and-facilities.md) and [API plan](../api/assets-and-facilities.md) as the review target.

**Source reconciliation:** [design-to-source map](../SOURCE-MAPPING.md#assets-and-facilities). No dedicated package name match was found for this layer in the scanned module manifests. Requirements and examples below describe the target design; the linked source reference records observed metadata and code, and does not certify release availability or implemented parity.

## Ownership and delivery scope

Maintenance owns operational assets, inspections and work orders; Accounting owns capitalization, depreciation and disposal postings. Enterprise coordinates custody, locations, facilities and cross-domain evidence.

Reuse the [shared enterprise operation design](../design/OPERATIONS.md) for command identities, concurrency, handoffs and recovery. This capability group adds only its own orchestration/projection and genuine missing behavior; it does not create another owner for existing product records.

## Workflow and command contract

**Workspace surfaces:** asset/custody search, handover checklist, inspection evidence, discrepancy queue, operational-to-financial reconciliation.

**Business lifecycle:** draft → approved → in_transit → accepted → reconciled; rejected and lost_or_damaged preserve custody evidence.

Keep physical asset identity distinct from its financial record. Require explicit custody acceptance, valid location/entity mappings, inspection evidence where needed, and a separate disposal authorization.

The illustrated `accept` command takes `to_custodian_reference`, `location_reference`, `condition_snapshot_id`, `acceptance_evidence_id`, with a documented record-version precondition and scoped operation identity. It starts from `in_transit` and reaches `accepted` only after its defined business outcome. The [API example](../api/assets-and-facilities.md#3-endpoint-examples) provides the proposed body and [draft request schema](../api/contracts/assets-and-facilities.request.schema.json).

Validate the receiving custodian, authorized location, required inspection and current custody version. Conflicting concurrent acceptance must not create two current custodians.

Record the accepted custody transition. Damage/discrepancy and financial capitalization/disposal stay with their respective owner workflows.

## Layer implementation

Use an explicit application use case for each reviewed transition. Inputs are authenticated actor/service context, authorized tenant/entity/subject references, expected subject version, scoped operation identity and a typed command DTO. Browser/request fields do not replace this trusted context.

The public result distinguishes validation/permission/stale-state rejection, a committed local decision and an accepted asynchronous operation. Publish only permitted DTO fields and evidence references; Eloquent models and upstream private tables are not the cross-module contract.

**Domain context fields:** `asset_reference`, `financial_asset_reference`, `from_custodian_reference`, `to_custodian_reference`, `location_reference`, `condition_snapshot_id`, `effective_at`, `acceptance_evidence_id`. These are design inputs/references, not a mandate to duplicate complete upstream records. Preserve owner identifiers and immutable decision/source snapshots where needed.

Store enterprise-owned orchestration changes transactionally and record outbox work with them. The shared operation journal owns delivery state; the business owner owns the actual transition. Use the owner concurrency contract for upstream writes and reconcile its acknowledgement before advancing a final outcome.

Maintenance publishes operational changes; Accounting records eligible financial events; People/foundation supplies authorized custodian references and access recovery tasks.

Migrations apply only to newly owned operation/projection state. Plan backfills, indexes, constraints, retention/holds and recovery without renaming or deleting another owner's records. Financial corrections use the owner reversal workflow; identity/access changes retain their revocation acknowledgements.

## Authorization, recovery and operations

Custodians acknowledge receipt; asset managers approve changes; finance authorizes capitalization/disposal financial effects.

Unaccepted or damaged handovers stay in a discrepancy queue. Never complete offboarding by deleting an assigned asset or clearing its custody history.

Show the selected entity, source/subject reference, current business state and separate operation progress. Preserve safe drafts on validation/conflict. Reauthenticate on expiry and discard protected cached data after scope/permission changes. A network timeout never establishes whether an external write succeeded; use the durable operation/source reference for reconciliation.

## Module-specific acceptance

- The same asset cannot be concurrently accepted by two custodians; damaged receipts remain unresolved; disposal retains financial and custody references.
- Repeated commands return the documented existing result or a clear conflict; they cannot duplicate a completed external side effect.
- A tenant/entity switch, permission revocation or expired session cannot reuse another scope's cached record, attachment or exported file.
- A downstream failure remains observable with a valid owner/recovery path across every enabled presentation.

- Exercise the `accept` example with allowed, denied, invalid, stale, duplicate and uncertain-result paths; confirm `accepted` only from its authoritative outcome.
- Verify the enabled layer uses the same domain/operation contract as other surfaces and cannot bypass it through generic saves, hydrated state, direct JSON fields or offline replay.
- Check scope changes, revoked permissions, evidence/result access, accessible errors and recovery in a representative consuming host. Record actual commands/results before describing the implementation as verified.

Use [testing](../../../standards/TESTING.md), [API architecture](../../../architecture/API.md), [shared operations](../design/OPERATIONS.md), and the [Composer](../../../guides/COMPOSER.md)/[npm](../../../guides/NPM.md) lifecycle guides for the remaining delivery requirements.
