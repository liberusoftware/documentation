# Governance, risk and compliance: Livewire design

**Status:** proposed enterprise implementation. The [current SAP foundation](../SOURCE-APPLICATION.md) does not establish these business workflows or this presentation as implemented. Use the [detailed domain contract](../design/governance-risk-and-compliance.md) and [API plan](../api/governance-risk-and-compliance.md) as the review target.

**Source reconciliation:** [design-to-source map](../SOURCE-MAPPING.md#governance-risk-and-compliance). No dedicated package name match was found for this layer in the scanned module manifests. Requirements and examples below describe the target design; the linked source reference records observed metadata and code, and does not certify release availability or implemented parity.

## Ownership and delivery scope

Reuse foundation audit, documents, policy and notification contracts. Enterprise owns control/risk relationships, assessments, evidence review and remediation oversight without overwriting source audit events.

Reuse the [shared enterprise operation design](../design/OPERATIONS.md) for command identities, concurrency, handoffs and recovery. This capability group adds only its own orchestration/projection and genuine missing behavior; it does not create another owner for existing product records.

## Workflow and command contract

**Workspace surfaces:** control library, risk register, evidence request inbox, finding/remediation timeline, audit-ready export preview.

**Business lifecycle:** planned → evidence_requested → under_review → accepted → closed; deficient and reopened preserve reviewer findings.

Version controls and frameworks, separate control operator from independent reviewer, retain immutable evidence references, and restrict sensitive findings. A policy document alone is not proof of effective operation.

The illustrated `record-finding` command takes `control_reference`, `finding_summary`, `evidence_references`, `remediation_owner_reference`, `due_at`, with a documented record-version precondition and scoped operation identity. It starts from `under_review` and reaches `deficient` only after its defined business outcome. The [API example](../api/governance-risk-and-compliance.md#3-endpoint-examples) provides the proposed body and [draft request schema](../api/contracts/governance-risk-and-compliance.request.schema.json).

Require independent review authority, accessible immutable evidence and a valid remediation owner. Preserve control/framework version and legal-hold/retention obligations.

Record the finding and linked remediation obligation without changing the original source audit evidence. Remediation acceptance is a distinct reviewed action.

## Layer implementation

Compose a workspace list, selected-subject detail, command form and operation-status component. Public component state contains only authorized filter values, opaque selection/version, safe command draft and operation reference; hydrated IDs are untrusted input.

The `record-finding` handler resolves the authenticated actor and current scope afresh, loads the authorized subject, validates `control_reference`, `finding_summary`, `evidence_references`, `remediation_owner_reference`, `due_at`, and calls the public application/API command. Protected lifecycle/audit/owner-result fields are not mass-assigned from component state.

Keep field validation messages with the draft and announce them accessibly. Disable repeat interaction while a request is pending for usability, while relying on server command identity/concurrency rules for correctness. After a confirmed write, reload authorized state rather than applying an assumed client-side final state.

Poll only an authorized operation reference at a bounded interval; stop/recover cleanly after expiry, revocation or navigation. Avoid persisting request-specific tenant/actor data in long-lived singleton/static state. File uploads need size/type checks and authorized evidence registration before use.

## Authorization, recovery and operations

Control owners submit; independent reviewers assess; auditors receive scoped read/export access; legal holds require designated authority.

Expired or unavailable evidence reopens the review obligation. Retries preserve evidence provenance and do not replace the original assessment result invisibly.

Show the selected entity, source/subject reference, current business state and separate operation progress. Preserve safe drafts on validation/conflict. Reauthenticate on expiry and discard protected cached data after scope/permission changes. A network timeout never establishes whether an external write succeeded; use the durable operation/source reference for reconciliation.

## Module-specific acceptance

- The operator cannot approve their own independent assessment; evidence access is rechecked on download; retention jobs preserve held records.
- Repeated commands return the documented existing result or a clear conflict; they cannot duplicate a completed external side effect.
- A tenant/entity switch, permission revocation or expired session cannot reuse another scope's cached record, attachment or exported file.
- A downstream failure remains observable with a valid owner/recovery path across every enabled presentation.

- Exercise the `record-finding` example with allowed, denied, invalid, stale, duplicate and uncertain-result paths; confirm `deficient` only from its authoritative outcome.
- Verify the enabled layer uses the same domain/operation contract as other surfaces and cannot bypass it through generic saves, hydrated state, direct JSON fields or offline replay.
- Check scope changes, revoked permissions, evidence/result access, accessible errors and recovery in a representative consuming host. Record actual commands/results before describing the implementation as verified.

Use [testing](../../../standards/TESTING.md), [API architecture](../../../architecture/API.md), [shared operations](../design/OPERATIONS.md), and the [Composer](../../../guides/COMPOSER.md)/[npm](../../../guides/NPM.md) lifecycle guides for the remaining delivery requirements.
