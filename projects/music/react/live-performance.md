# Liberu Music: Live Performance and Setlists — React + Inertia

**Status: proposed design.** These are requirements and design identifiers, not verified source packages, published artifacts or implemented features.

**Design identifier:** `module-music-live-performance-react`. Uses [core](../core/live-performance.md) and, for remote access, [API](../api/live-performance.md).

## Surface workflow

Present: prepare a set, preload the next song and recover a failed device during rehearsal. Domain scope: setlists, cue preparation, preloaded projects, scene transitions and performance recovery.

Use typed Inertia props and authorized Laravel actions for server state. Keep timeline gestures, engine handles and transient meters in client state; dispose audio contexts and subscriptions on navigation.

Apply the [surface support matrix](../PRESENTATION.md) before enabling editing, capture or DSP. For unsupported local capabilities, provide metadata/review and an explicit handoff to a capable host; never imply that a remote server is monitoring live audio.

Show loading, empty, denied, missing-device/plugin/media, pending-sync, conflict and failed-job states as applicable. Preserve drafts and expose retry/cancel with authoritative results. Use keyboard and screen-reader alternatives for visual controls, scalable text, reduced motion and labeled meters.

## Verification

Measure transition gaps and peak memory; rehearse missing-media and device-failure paths. Verify the supported subset on the actual target runtime, navigation cleanup, permission denial and offline recovery. Mobile acceptance requires physical iOS/Android devices and release builds. Honor the invariant through the owning contract: set changes are preflighted for missing assets and bounded CPU/memory use.
