# Liberu Music: Media Library and Content — Livewire

**Status: proposed design.** These are requirements and design identifiers, not verified source packages, published artifacts or implemented features.

**Design identifier:** `module-music-media-library-livewire`. Uses [core](../core/media-library.md) and, for remote access, [API](../api/media-library.md).

## Surface workflow

Present: import recordings, index peaks, find samples and resolve a missing asset. Domain scope: content-addressed audio assets, waveform peaks, metadata, tags, search, packs and rights provenance.

Use server-rendered forms for metadata and review. Keep frequent meter/waveform updates in a client component with explicit lifecycle cleanup; avoid server round trips for audio control loops.

Apply the [surface support matrix](../PRESENTATION.md) before enabling editing, capture or DSP. For unsupported local capabilities, provide metadata/review and an explicit handoff to a capable host; never imply that a remote server is monitoring live audio.

Show loading, empty, denied, missing-device/plugin/media, pending-sync, conflict and failed-job states as applicable. Preserve drafts and expose retry/cancel with authoritative results. Use keyboard and screen-reader alternatives for visual controls, scalable text, reduced motion and labeled meters.

## Verification

Verify checksums, resumable upload, duplicate detection and referenced-asset retention. Verify the supported subset on the actual target runtime, navigation cleanup, permission denial and offline recovery. Mobile acceptance requires physical iOS/Android devices and release builds. Honor the invariant through the owning contract: only verified complete assets become available to a session revision.
