# Files: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-control-panel-files`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-control-panel-files-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/files.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **2 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-control-panel-files](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-control-panel-files.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-control-panel-files-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-control-panel-files-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Home directories | A focused authorized view or workflow section for home directories; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Permissions | A focused authorized view or workflow section for permissions; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| SFTP | A focused authorized view or workflow section for sftp; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| File operations | A focused authorized view or workflow section for file operations; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Quotas | A focused authorized view or workflow section for quotas; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Scanning | A focused authorized view or workflow section for scanning; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Retention | A focused authorized view or workflow section for retention; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

These are observed PHP query entry points, not assumed HTTP endpoints. Use an owning API adapter to authorize and serialize their results.

| Source query | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [ListFiles.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Queries/ListFiles.php) | `public function execute(string $teamId, int $perPage = 25, string $search = ''): LengthAwarePaginator` |

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [CreateHomeDirectory.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Actions/CreateHomeDirectory.php) | `public function execute(array $attributes): HomeDirectory` |

| [DeleteFile.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Actions/DeleteFile.php) | `public function execute(FileEntry $file): FileEntry` |
| [DeleteSftpAccount.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Actions/DeleteSftpAccount.php) | `public function execute(SftpAccount $account): void` |

| [MarkFileScanned.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Actions/MarkFileScanned.php) | `public function execute(FileEntry $file, bool $clean): FileEntry` |
| [RecordFileOperation.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Actions/RecordFileOperation.php) | `public function execute(array $a): FileOperation` |
| [RegenerateSftpKeyPair.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Actions/RegenerateSftpKeyPair.php) | `public function execute(SftpAccount $account, ?int $bits = null): array` |
| [RegisterFile.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Actions/RegisterFile.php) | `public function execute(array $attributes): FileEntry` |
| [SetFileQuota.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Actions/SetFileQuota.php) | `public function execute(array $attributes): FileQuota` |
| [SetFileRetention.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Actions/SetFileRetention.php) | `public function execute(array $attributes): FileRetention` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [FileEntry.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Models/FileEntry.php) | `team_id`, `owner_id`, `path`, `disk`, `mime_type`, `size_bytes`, `checksum`, `status`, `scanned_at`, `retention_until`, `metadata` |
| [FileOperation.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Models/FileOperation.php) | `id`, `team_id`, `file_id`, `operation`, `status`, `details` |
| [FilePermission.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Models/FilePermission.php) | `id`, `team_id`, `file_id`, `home_directory_id`, `subject_id`, `subject_type`, `mode`, `recursive` |
| [FileQuota.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Models/FileQuota.php) | `id`, `team_id`, `owner_id`, `limit_bytes`, `used_bytes`, `files_count` |
| [FileRetention.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Models/FileRetention.php) | `id`, `team_id`, `file_id`, `retention_until`, `policy`, `active` |
| [HomeDirectory.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files/src/Models/HomeDirectory.php) | `id`, `team_id`, `owner_id`, `path`, `disk`, `mode`, `status`, `metadata` |

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/control-panel-files-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-control-panel-laravel-filament/blob/1797f25d705f780bacddcdf228c9a1dc995c3580/modules/control-panel-files-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::prefix('api/v1/control-panel/files')->middleware(['api', 'auth:sanctum', 'throttle:60,1'])->group(function (): void {
Route::get('/', [FileController::class, 'index'])->name('control-panel.files.index');
Route::post('/', [FileController::class, 'store'])->name('control-panel.files.store');
Route::post('/operations', [FileController::class, 'operation'])->name('control-panel.files.operations.store');
Route::post('/home-directories', [FileController::class, 'home'])->name('control-panel.files.home-directories.store');
Route::post('/permissions', [FileController::class, 'permission'])->name('control-panel.files.permissions.store');
Route::post('/sftp-accounts', [FileController::class, 'sftp'])->name('control-panel.files.sftp-accounts.store');
Route::delete('/sftp-accounts/{sftpAccount}', [FileController::class, 'deleteSftp'])->name('control-panel.files.sftp-accounts.delete');
Route::post('/sftp-accounts/{sftpAccount}/regenerate-keys', [FileController::class, 'regenerateSftpKeys'])->name('control-panel.files.sftp-accounts.regenerate-keys');
Route::post('/retention', [FileController::class, 'retention'])->name('control-panel.files.retention.store');
Route::post('/quotas', [FileController::class, 'quota'])->name('control-panel.files.quotas.store');
Route::delete('/{file}', [FileController::class, 'delete'])->name('control-panel.files.delete');
Route::get('{file}', [FileController::class, 'show'])->name('control-panel.files.show');
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.
