# Theme Integration: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-cms-theme-integration`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-cms-theme-integration-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/theme-integration.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **3 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-cms-theme-integration](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-cms-theme-integration.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-cms-theme-integration-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-cms-theme-integration-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Theme selection by site/channel | A focused authorized view or workflow section for theme selection by site/channel; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Regions | A focused authorized view or workflow section for regions; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| View contracts | A focused authorized view or workflow section for view contracts; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Component registry | A focused authorized view or workflow section for component registry; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Inheritance | A focused authorized view or workflow section for inheritance; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Preview | A focused authorized view or workflow section for preview; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Safe fallback | A focused authorized view or workflow section for safe fallback; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

These are observed PHP query entry points, not assumed HTTP endpoints. Use an owning API adapter to authorize and serialize their results.

| Source query | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [ThemeIntegrationQuery.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/cms-laravel/blob/5d91aa9c0a3d4ae6b1cf238b324e9d0a05ba68e7/modules/cms-theme-integration/src/Queries/ThemeIntegrationQuery.php) | `public function bindings(int $perPage = 15, ?int $teamId = null): LengthAwarePaginator`<br>`public function binding(string $siteKey, ?string $channelKey = null, ?int $teamId = null): ?ThemeBinding`<br>`public function bindingById(int\|string $id, ?int $teamId = null): ?ThemeBinding`<br>`public function components(string $themeKey, ?string $region = null, ?int $teamId = null): array` |

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [ThemeIntegrationService.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/cms-laravel/blob/5d91aa9c0a3d4ae6b1cf238b324e9d0a05ba68e7/modules/cms-theme-integration/src/Services/ThemeIntegrationService.php) | `public function bind(string $siteKey, ?string $channelKey, string $themeKey, string $fallbackThemeKey = 'default', ?int $teamId = null): ThemeBinding`<br>`public function updateBinding(ThemeBinding $binding, array $attributes): ThemeBinding`<br>`public function removeBinding(ThemeBinding $binding): void`<br>`public function select(?string $siteKey, ?string $channelKey = null, ?int $teamId = null): ?ThemeBinding`<br>`public function effectiveTheme(?string $siteKey, ?string $channelKey = null, ?int $teamId = null): string`<br>`public function registerComponent(string $themeKey, string $region, string $componentKey, array $viewContract = [], array $configuration = [], ?int $teamId = null): ThemeComponent`<br>`public function components(string $themeKey, ?string $region = null, ?int $teamId = null): array`<br>`public function previewToken(ThemeBinding $binding): string`<br>`public function preview(ThemeBinding $binding, string $token): bool` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [ThemeBinding.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/cms-laravel/blob/5d91aa9c0a3d4ae6b1cf238b324e9d0a05ba68e7/modules/cms-theme-integration/src/Models/ThemeBinding.php) | `site_key`, `channel_key`, `theme_key`, `fallback_theme_key`, `preview_token`, `preview_expires_at`, `active`, `team_id` |
| [ThemeComponent.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/cms-laravel/blob/5d91aa9c0a3d4ae6b1cf238b324e9d0a05ba68e7/modules/cms-theme-integration/src/Models/ThemeComponent.php) | `theme_key`, `region`, `component_key`, `view_contract`, `configuration`, `team_id` |

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.
