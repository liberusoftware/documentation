# CMS: Content Calendar API

<!-- source-reconciliation:start -->
**Source reconciliation:** [design-to-source map](../SOURCE-MAPPING.md#content-calendar). Observed identity: [`liberusoftware/module-cms-content-calendar-api`](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-cms-content-calendar-api.md). Requirements and examples below describe the target design; the linked source reference records observed metadata and code, and does not certify release availability or implemented parity.

## Canonical one-to-one API module specification

**Proposed API design identifier:** `module-cms-content-calendar-api`
**Matching domain module:** `cms-content-calendar`
**Application:** CMS
**Source feature:** [Content Calendar](../features/content-calendar.md)
**Architecture:** [API.md](../../../architecture/API.md) · [MODULES.md](../../../architecture/MODULES.md) · [TESTING.md](../../../standards/TESTING.md)

## 1. Purpose and ownership

This optional API presentation package exposes approved HTTP operations for the Content Calendar domain module. It presents exactly one independent module, delegates all authoritative behavior to that module's public actions/queries/policies, and contains no other module's API logic.

The domain capability includes:

- Editorial calendar
- campaigns
- deadlines
- assignments
- conflicts
- drag/drop rescheduling
- channel/site filters

Installation does not expose every capability automatically. The host application selects this package, API version, audiences, route groups, and operations in its API manifest.

## 2. Contract design

- Publish an OpenAPI 3.1 fragment with stable operation IDs, schemas, examples, scopes, errors, pagination, rate limits, idempotency, and deprecation metadata.
- Choose the route namespace through the host's reviewed API contract; observed source prefixes below take precedence over repository/design-name guesses.
- Represent resources through explicit API DTOs/resources rather than automatic Eloquent serialization.
- Use lowercase kebab-case paths, snake_case JSON fields, opaque identifiers, ISO 8601 timestamps, explicit money objects, and RFC 9457 Problem Details errors.
- Compatible additions remain within the major version; removals or semantic breaks require a new major version or approved migration path.

## 3. Endpoint examples

**Contract status:** use the observed source below for current route/handler/schema evidence. The surrounding module scope is a target design; its feature labels are not request field names. Do not generate a create/update/delete payload or final URL by mechanically copying the design identifier.

| Boundary | Observed identity and implementation reference |
| --- | --- |
| Source package | [liberusoftware/module-cms-content-calendar-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-cms-content-calendar-api.md) |
| Source package | [liberusoftware/module-cms-content-calendar](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-cms-content-calendar.md) |

No route file was established under the matched module roots for this spelling. That is a source-location observation, not proof that the capability has no API or UI. Review application-owned routes and the public domain boundary before proposing HTTP commands.

A client example is valid only after its exact request/response contract is established. Record required/nullable fields, business units, allowed values, operation identity/concurrency support, result/pagination envelope and recovery. An `Idempotency-Key` or `If-Match` example does not establish server support by itself.

## 4. OpenAPI schema

The matched source contains these machine-readable contract/schema files. Verify their version and parity with handlers; file presence does not prove deployed compatibility or a passing validation run.

- [modules/module-cms-content-calendar-api/openapi/v1/cms-content-calendar.yaml](https://github.com/liberusoftware/cms-laravel/blob/5d91aa9c0a3d4ae6b1cf238b324e9d0a05ba68e7/modules/module-cms-content-calendar-api/openapi/v1/cms-content-calendar.yaml)

For the target contract, define stable operation IDs, explicit request/resource/collection/error schemas, allowed audiences/scopes, actor/tenant resolution, field sensitivity, pagination/filter limits, concurrency and retry semantics. Use the real manifest identity and actual route namespace, not a guessed repository-derived package or path.

Validate/bundle the fragment, check supported-version compatibility and generate clients only from the reviewed contract. Retain the source/schema commit or release in client compatibility notes. See the [API architecture](../../../architecture/API.md), [source mapping](../SOURCE-MAPPING.md#content-calendar), and [Composer](../../../guides/COMPOSER.md)/[npm](../../../guides/NPM.md) guides.

## 5. Audience and operation matrix

| Audience                       | Default exposure                    | Required controls                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public/anonymous               | Disabled unless explicitly required | Enumeration resistance, strict rate limits, field minimization, abuse controls         |
| Authenticated customer/partner | Explicit allowlist                  | Tenant/resource ownership, purpose-specific scopes, field policy                       |
| Staff/administrator            | Explicit allowlist                  | Role/permission policy, tenant context, recent authentication for risky actions, audit |
| Service/integration client     | Explicit allowlist                  | Service identity, least-privilege scopes, expiry/rotation, idempotency, quotas         |

Every exposed operation must map to one audience, domain query/action, permission/scope, request/response schema, rate limit, idempotency/concurrency policy, audit event, and test set. Unmapped operations fail CI.

## 6. Implementation strategy

- Keep routes, controllers/handlers, requests, API resources, OpenAPI fragments, and transport tests in this API package.
- Validate shape at the request boundary and enforce authoritative invariants again in the domain action.
- Resolve tenant and actor context from trusted authentication/application routing; never grant context from a caller-supplied tenant identifier alone.
- Authorize field visibility as well as record/action access, and return concealment-safe errors where enumeration is a risk.
- Use idempotency keys for retryable writes, ETags/`If-Match` for relevant concurrent updates, and asynchronous operation resources for slow/bulk/provider-dependent work.
- Compose cross-module workflows in the application layer; do not query or mutate another module's private storage from this API package.

## 7. Security, resilience, and observability

- Threat-model authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, mass assignment, object references, abusive queries, uploads/downloads, webhooks, and sensitive data.
- Bound pagination, filters, includes, payloads, batch sizes, timeouts, and retry budgets.
- Redact credentials and protected data from logs and errors while recording request, correlation, API/module/version, tenant, principal, operation, status, latency, rate-limit, and idempotency outcomes.
- Define availability, latency, error-rate and queued-operation objectives plus aler…172152 tokens truncated….
- **Transforms:** page, component, hook, form, and failure-state behavior for this module's authorized workflow.
- **Identity/media/link resolution:** page, component, hook, form, and failure-state behavior for this module's authorized workflow.
- **Batches:** page, component, hook, form, and failure-state behavior for this module's authorized workflow.
- **Resume:** page, component, hook, form, and failure-state behavior for this module's authorized workflow.
- **Reconciliation:** page, component, hook, form, and failure-state behavior for this module's authorized workflow.

## 3. Vue 3 + Inertia 3 implementation

- Register a stable `module-cms-migration-framework-vue-inertia` package and expose only explicitly prefixed public exports; applications compose it explicitly.
- Keep Inertia pages under `resources/js/Pages`, shared UI under `resources/js/Components`, composables under `resources/js/composables`, typed contracts under `resources/js/types`, and transport/error adapters under `resources/js/lib`.
- Use `createInertiaApp`, `Link`, `router`, `useForm`, typed page props, loading/error states, and accessible components over the matching API contract; never duplicate server-side invariants in client validation.
- Resolve actor, team, locale, and sensitive-field visibility through trusted Laravel/API context and fail closed when required context is missing.

### Capability mapping

- `source-adapters`: map the matching API query/action to a focused Vue page, component, hook, or Inertia form.
- `inventories`: map the matching API query/action to a focused Vue page, component, hook, or Inertia form.
- `mapping`: map the matching API query/action to a focused Vue page, component, hook, or Inertia form.
- `dry-run`: map the matching API query/action to a focused Vue page, component, hook, or Inertia form.
- `transforms`: map the matching API query/action to a focused Vue page, component, hook, or Inertia form.
- `identity-media-link-resolution`: map the matching API query/action to a focused Vue page, component, hook, or Inertia form.
- `batches`: map the matching API query/action to a focused Vue page, component, hook, or Inertia form.
- `resume`: map the matching API query/action to a focused Vue page, component, hook, or Inertia form.
- `reconciliation`: map the matching API query/action to a focused Vue page, component, hook, or Inertia form.

## 4. API contract and Inertia consumption

- Consume only the matching API module linked above; use its documented OpenAPI schemas, routes, authentication, permissions, team context, pagination, errors, and operation semantics.
- Keep a typed module-local API client and hooks boundary; use Inertia visits for page transitions and `useForm`/`router` for mutations, preserving server validation and redirect semantics.
- Forward Sanctum cookies or approved authorization headers through a controlled first-party boundary; never persist long-lived tokens in browser storage or expose secrets in page props.
- Validate client input for user experience, but rely on the API for authoritative authorization, validation, concurrency, idempotency, and business invariants.
- Map loading, empty, stale, unauthorized, forbidden, validation, rate-limit, and server-error responses to accessible UI states.

## 5. Security and verification

- Prove allowed, denied, wrong-team, invalid, stale/concurrent, duplicate, partial-failure, and recovery paths for every exposed surface.
- Add package discovery/collision, architecture-boundary, authorization, team-context, accessibility, localization, SSR hydration where enabled, and minimal-host installation tests.
- Test observable behavior with TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest, Vue Test Utils, Playwright, and the supported Laravel/Inertia stack; domain behavior remains covered by the owning module.

## 6. Definition of done

- Package identity, public exports, API dependency, and module dependency match `cms-migration-framework` one-to-one.
- Every required route or application surface has an explicit page/component/hook/form/API-action mapping and no undeclared surface is discovered.
- Production asset/SSR build, route generation, API contract compatibility, authorization, team isolation, accessibility, compatibility, and meaningful TypeScript coverage gates pass.
