# Social Network React Native + Expo implementations

**Scope:** [Social Network](../SOCIAL-NETWORK.md)
**Architecture:** [Mobile](../../../architecture/MOBILE.md) · [API](../api/README.md) · [Core](../core/README.md)
**Technology:** [React Native technology](../../../technologies/REACT-NATIVE.md) · [React Native standard](../../../standards/REACT-NATIVE.md)

This index defines the optional React Native + Expo adapter boundary for the Social Network project. Each future module adapter must map one-to-one to an existing core/API capability, preserve the server contract, and remain independently testable. Product-specific domain behavior stays in the project feature and core documentation.

## Implementation plan

- Consume the matching versioned API contract; do not query private tables or duplicate Laravel authorization, tenant resolution, audit, or business rules.
- Provide platform-appropriate navigation, screens/widgets, forms, validation feedback, loading/empty/denied/offline/conflict/recovery states, and localization.
- Document native permissions, secure credential storage, deep links, push notifications, cache classification, offline mutation policy, and supported OS/device matrix.
- Test API schemas and authorization, state transitions, accessibility, localization, lifecycle interruptions, permission denial, offline recovery, and signed release builds.
- Keep package naming consistent: `module-{independent-module-name}-react-native`; host applications choose only the adapters they need.

This project may ship no mobile client, one mobile client, or both. A missing adapter is an explicit product decision and must not be interpreted as permission to move domain behavior into the client.
