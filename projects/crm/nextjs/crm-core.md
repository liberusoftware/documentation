# CRM Core: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-crm-core`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-crm-core-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/crm-core.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-crm-core](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-crm-core.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-crm-core-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-crm-core-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Contacts | A focused authorized view or workflow section for contacts; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Organizations | A focused authorized view or workflow section for organizations; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Households | A focused authorized view or workflow section for households; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Relationships | A focused authorized view or workflow section for relationships; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Owners | A focused authorized view or workflow section for owners; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Teams | A focused authorized view or workflow section for teams; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Tags | A focused authorized view or workflow section for tags; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Notes | A focused authorized view or workflow section for notes; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Attachments | A focused authorized view or workflow section for attachments; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Favorites | A focused authorized view or workflow section for favorites; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Record lifecycle | A focused authorized view or workflow section for record lifecycle; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Unified timeline | A focused authorized view or workflow section for unified timeline; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [AddNote.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-crm-laravel-filament/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-core/src/Actions/AddNote.php) | `public function execute(Record $record, string $body, ?int $authorId = null): Note` |
| [ArchiveRecord.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-crm-laravel-filament/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-core/src/Actions/ArchiveRecord.php) | `public function execute(Record $record): Record` |

| [CreateRelationship.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-crm-laravel-filament/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-core/src/Actions/CreateRelationship.php) | `public function execute(Record $from, Record $to, string $type, array $metadata = []): Relationship` |
| [CreateTag.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-crm-laravel-filament/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-core/src/Actions/CreateTag.php) | `public function execute(int $teamId, string $name): Tag` |

| [EloquentRecordRepository.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-crm-laravel-filament/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-core/src/Services/EloquentRecordRepository.php) | `public function find(string $type, int\|string $id): ?Record`<br>`public function paginate(string $type, int $perPage = 25): LengthAwarePaginator` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/crm-core-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-crm-laravel-filament/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-core-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::prefix('api/v1/crm/crm-core')->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'throttle:api'])->group(function (): void {
Route::get('/', [RecordController::class, 'index'])->name('crm.core.list');
Route::post('/', [RecordController::class, 'store'])->name('crm.core.create');
Route::get('/tags', [RecordController::class, 'tags'])->name('crm.core.tags.list');
Route::post('/tags', [RecordController::class, 'createTag'])->name('crm.core.tags.create');
Route::get('/{record}', [RecordController::class, 'show'])->name('crm.core.get');
Route::patch('/{record}', [RecordController::class, 'update'])->name('crm.core.update');
Route::get('/{record}/timeline', [RecordController::class, 'timeline'])->name('crm.core.timeline');
Route::post('/{record}/notes', [RecordController::class, 'addNote'])->name('crm.core.notes.create');
Route::post('/{record}/relationships', [RecordController::class, 'relationship'])->name('crm.core.relationships.create');
Route::post('/{record}/tags/{tag}', [RecordController::class, 'tag'])->name('crm.core.tags.attach');
Route::post('/{record}/favorite', [RecordController::class, 'favorite'])->name('crm.core.favorite');
Route::delete('/{record}', [RecordController::class, 'destroy'])->name('crm.core.delete');
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.

See the [Next.js standard](../../../standards/NEXTJS.md), [npm lifecycle guide](../../../guides/NPM.md), [API architecture](../../../architecture/API.md), and [shared ownership guide](../../../architecture/SHARED-MODULES.md).
