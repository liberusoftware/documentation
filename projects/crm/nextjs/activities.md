# Activities: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-crm-activities`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-crm-activities-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/activities.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **2 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-crm-activities](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-crm-activities.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-crm-activities-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-crm-activities-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Tasks | A focused authorized view or workflow section for tasks; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Calls | A focused authorized view or workflow section for calls; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Meetings | A focused authorized view or workflow section for meetings; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Emails | A focused authorized view or workflow section for emails; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Deadlines | A focused authorized view or workflow section for deadlines; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Recurrence | A focused authorized view or workflow section for recurrence; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Queues | A focused authorized view or workflow section for queues; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Bulk completion | A focused authorized view or workflow section for bulk completion; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Reminders | A focused authorized view or workflow section for reminders; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Outcomes | A focused authorized view or workflow section for outcomes; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Goals | A focused authorized view or workflow section for goals; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Activity reporting | A focused authorized view or workflow section for activity reporting; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [CancelActivity.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-activities/src/Actions/CancelActivity.php) | `public function execute(Activity $activity): Activity` |
| [CompleteActivities.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-activities/src/Actions/CompleteActivities.php) | `public function execute(int $teamId, array $activityIds, ?string $outcome = null, ?string $notes = null): int` |
| [CreateActivity.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-activities/src/Actions/CreateActivity.php) | `public function execute(int $teamId, ?int $actorId, array $attributes): Activity` |
| [CreateActivityGoal.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-activities/src/Actions/CreateActivityGoal.php) | `public function execute(int $teamId, array $attributes): ActivityGoal` |
| [ActivityReport.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-activities/src/Services/ActivityReport.php) | `public function summarize(int $teamId, Carbon $from, Carbon $until): array` |
| [ActivityScheduler.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-activities/src/Services/ActivityScheduler.php) | `public function nextOccurrence(Activity $activity): ?Activity`<br>`public function dueReminders(int $teamId, ?Carbon $at = null): Collection` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [Activity.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-activities/src/Models/Activity.php) | `team_id`, `actor_id`, `assigned_to`, `kind`, `status`, `title`, `description`, `subject_type`, `subject_id`, `starts_at`, `due_at`, `ends_at`, `recurrence`, `recurrence_until`, `reminder_at`, `queue`, `outcome`, `outcome_notes`, `metadata`, `completed_at` |
| [ActivityEvent.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-activities/src/Models/ActivityEvent.php) | `team_id`, `activity_id`, `actor_id`, `event`, `details` |
| [ActivityGoal.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-activities/src/Models/ActivityGoal.php) | `team_id`, `owner_id`, `name`, `kind`, `target`, `progress`, `starts_at`, `ends_at`, `status`, `criteria` |

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/crm-activities-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/crm-laravel/blob/63aad94e94c0f9a18038e301eb979138c657be64/modules/crm-activities-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'throttle:api'])->prefix('api/v1/crm/activities')->group(function (): void {
Route::get('/', [ActivityController::class, 'index']);
Route::post('/', [ActivityController::class, 'store']);
Route::get('/report', [ActivityController::class, 'report']);
Route::post('/complete', [ActivityController::class, 'complete']);
Route::get('/{activity}', [ActivityController::class, 'show']);
Route::patch('/{activity}', [ActivityController::class, 'update']);
Route::post('/{activity}/cancel', [ActivityController::class, 'cancel']);
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.
