# Payments: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-billing-payments`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-billing-payments-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/payments.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **2 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-billing-payments](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-billing-payments.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-billing-payments-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-billing-payments-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Methods | A focused authorized view or workflow section for methods; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Mandates | A focused authorized view or workflow section for mandates; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Gateway drivers | A focused authorized view or workflow section for gateway drivers; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Capture | A focused authorized view or workflow section for capture; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Allocation | A focused authorized view or workflow section for allocation; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Refunds | A focused authorized view or workflow section for refunds; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Disputes | A focused authorized view or workflow section for disputes; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Reconciliation | A focused authorized view or workflow section for reconciliation; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

These are observed PHP query entry points, not assumed HTTP endpoints. Use an owning API adapter to authorize and serialize their results.

| Source query | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [ListPayments.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Queries/ListPayments.php) | `public function execute(?int $teamId, int $perPage = 25): LengthAwarePaginator` |

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [AllocatePayment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Actions/AllocatePayment.php) | `public function execute(Payment $payment, int $amountMinor, ?int $invoiceId = null): PaymentAllocation` |
| [CapturePayment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Actions/CapturePayment.php) | `public function execute(Payment $payment): Payment` |
| [CreatePayment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Actions/CreatePayment.php) | `public function execute(array $attributes): Payment` |
| [CreatePaymentMandate.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Actions/CreatePaymentMandate.php) | `public function execute(array $attributes): PaymentMandate` |
| [CreatePaymentMethod.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Actions/CreatePaymentMethod.php) | `public function execute(array $attributes): PaymentMethod` |
| [OpenDispute.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Actions/OpenDispute.php) | `public function execute(Payment $payment, int $amountMinor, string $reason): PaymentDispute` |
| [ReconcilePayment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Actions/ReconcilePayment.php) | `public function execute(Payment $payment, string $providerReference, bool $matched = true, ?string $notes = null): PaymentReconciliation` |
| [RefundPayment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Actions/RefundPayment.php) | `public function execute(Payment $payment, int $amountMinor, string $reason = 'requested'): PaymentRefund` |
| [TransitionPaymentMandate.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Actions/TransitionPaymentMandate.php) | `public function execute(PaymentMandate $mandate, string $status): PaymentMandate` |
| [TransitionPaymentMethod.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Actions/TransitionPaymentMethod.php) | `public function execute(PaymentMethod $method, PaymentMethodStatus $status): PaymentMethod` |
| [GatewayManager.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Services/GatewayManager.php) | `public function register(string $name, GatewayDriver $driver): void`<br>`public function driver(string $name): GatewayDriver` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [Payment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Models/Payment.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |
| [PaymentAllocation.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Models/PaymentAllocation.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |
| [PaymentDispute.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Models/PaymentDispute.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |
| [PaymentMandate.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Models/PaymentMandate.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |
| [PaymentMethod.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Models/PaymentMethod.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |
| [PaymentReconciliation.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Models/PaymentReconciliation.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |
| [PaymentRefund.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments/src/Models/PaymentRefund.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/module-billing-payments-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/billing-laravel/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-payments-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::middleware(['api', 'throttle:api', 'auth:sanctum', 'ability:billing.payments.read'])
Route::get('/', [PaymentController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
Route::get('/{payment}', [PaymentController::class, 'show'])->whereNumber('payment')->name('show');
Route::get('/methods', [PaymentMethodController::class, 'methods'])->name('methods.index');
Route::get('/mandates', [PaymentMethodController::class, 'mandates'])->name('mandates.index');
Route::middleware(['api', 'throttle:api', 'auth:sanctum', 'ability:billing.payments.write', 'idempotency'])
Route::post('/', [PaymentController::class, 'store'])->name('store');
Route::post('/methods', [PaymentMethodController::class, 'storeMethod'])->name('methods.store');
Route::post('/mandates', [PaymentMethodController::class, 'storeMandate'])->name('mandates.store');
Route::patch('/methods/{method}/status', [PaymentMethodController::class, 'transitionMethod'])->whereNumber('method')->name('methods.status');
Route::patch('/mandates/{mandate}/status', [PaymentMethodController::class, 'transitionMandate'])->whereNumber('mandate')->name('mandates.status');
Route::post('/{payment}/capture', [PaymentController::class, 'capture'])->name('capture');
Route::post('/{payment}/refund', [PaymentController::class, 'refund'])->name('refund');
Route::post('/{payment}/dispute', [PaymentController::class, 'dispute'])->name('dispute');
Route::post('/{payment}/allocate', [PaymentController::class, 'allocate'])->name('allocate');
Route::post('/{payment}/reconcile', [PaymentController::class, 'reconcile'])->name('reconcile');
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.

See the [Next.js standard](../../../standards/NEXTJS.md), [npm lifecycle guide](../../../guides/NPM.md), [API architecture](../../../architecture/API.md), and [shared ownership guide](../../../architecture/SHARED-MODULES.md).
