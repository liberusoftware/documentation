# Usage: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-billing-usage`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-billing-usage-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/usage.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **2 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-billing-usage](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-billing-usage.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-billing-usage-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-billing-usage-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Meter definitions | A focused authorized view or workflow section for meter definitions; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Ingestion | A focused authorized view or workflow section for ingestion; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Deduplication | A focused authorized view or workflow section for deduplication; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Aggregation | A focused authorized view or workflow section for aggregation; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Rating | A focused authorized view or workflow section for rating; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Corrections | A focused authorized view or workflow section for corrections; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Thresholds | A focused authorized view or workflow section for thresholds; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

These are observed PHP query entry points, not assumed HTTP endpoints. Use an owning API adapter to authorize and serialize their results.

| Source query | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [AggregateUsage.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage/src/Queries/AggregateUsage.php) | `public function execute(int $meterId, ?int $customerId = null): object` |
| [ListMeters.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage/src/Queries/ListMeters.php) | `public function execute(?int $teamId = null): Collection` |
| [ListUsageRecords.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage/src/Queries/ListUsageRecords.php) | `public function execute(?int $teamId = null, ?int $meterId = null): Collection` |

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [CheckUsageThreshold.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage/src/Actions/CheckUsageThreshold.php) | `public function execute(Meter $meter, float $quantity): bool` |
| [CorrectUsage.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage/src/Actions/CorrectUsage.php) | `public function execute(UsageRecord $record, float $quantity, string $eventKey): UsageRecord` |
| [DefineMeter.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage/src/Actions/DefineMeter.php) | `public function execute(array $attributes): Meter` |
| [IngestUsage.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage/src/Actions/IngestUsage.php) | `public function execute(Meter $meter, array $attributes): UsageRecord` |
| [RateUsage.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage/src/Actions/RateUsage.php) | `public function execute(Meter $meter, float $quantity): int` |
| [TransitionMeter.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage/src/Actions/TransitionMeter.php) | `public function execute(Meter $meter, bool $active): Meter` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [Meter.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage/src/Models/Meter.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |
| [UsageRecord.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage/src/Models/UsageRecord.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/module-billing-usage-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-usage-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::middleware(['api', 'throttle:api', 'auth:sanctum', 'ability:billing.usage.read'])->prefix('api/v1/billing/usage')->name('billing.usage.')->group(function (): void {
Route::get('/meters', [UsageController::class, 'meters'])->name('meters');
Route::get('/meters/{meter}/aggregate', [UsageController::class, 'aggregateForMeter'])->name('aggregate');
Route::post('/meters/{meter}/rate', [UsageController::class, 'rate'])->name('rate');
Route::get('/records', [UsageController::class, 'records'])->name('records.index');
Route::get('/aggregate', [UsageController::class, 'aggregate'])->name('records.aggregate');
Route::middleware(['api', 'throttle:api', 'auth:sanctum', 'ability:billing.usage.write', 'idempotency'])->prefix('api/v1/billing/usage')->name('billing.usage.')->group(function (): void {
Route::post('/meters', [UsageController::class, 'storeMeter'])->name('meters.store');
Route::patch('/meters/{meter}/status', [UsageController::class, 'transitionMeter'])->whereNumber('meter')->name('meters.status');
Route::post('/meters/{meter}/records', [UsageController::class, 'ingest'])->name('records.store');
Route::post('/meters/{meter}/ingest', [UsageController::class, 'ingest'])->name('records.ingest');
Route::post('/records/{record}/correct', [UsageController::class, 'correct'])->name('records.correct');
Route::post('/records/{record}/corrections', [UsageController::class, 'correct'])->name('records.corrected');
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.
