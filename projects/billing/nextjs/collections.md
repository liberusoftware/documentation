# Collections: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/module-billing-collections`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-billing-collections-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/collections.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **2 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/module-billing-collections](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-billing-collections.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/module-billing-collections-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--module-billing-collections-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Retries | A focused authorized view or workflow section for retries; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Dunning | A focused authorized view or workflow section for dunning; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Reminders | A focused authorized view or workflow section for reminders; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Promises | A focused authorized view or workflow section for promises; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Credit control | A focused authorized view or workflow section for credit control; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Suspension | A focused authorized view or workflow section for suspension; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Write-off | A focused authorized view or workflow section for write-off; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Recovery | A focused authorized view or workflow section for recovery; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

These are observed PHP query entry points, not assumed HTTP endpoints. Use an owning API adapter to authorize and serialize their results.

| Source query | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [ListCollectionCases.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections/src/Queries/ListCollectionCases.php) | `public function execute(?int $teamId, int $perPage = 25): LengthAwarePaginator` |

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [ApplyCreditControl.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections/src/Actions/ApplyCreditControl.php) | `public function execute(CollectionCase $case, string $level, ?string $reason = null): CollectionCase` |
| [OpenCollectionCase.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections/src/Actions/OpenCollectionCase.php) | `public function execute(array $attributes): CollectionCase` |
| [PromisePayment.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections/src/Actions/PromisePayment.php) | `public function execute(CollectionCase $case, \DateTimeInterface $dueAt): CollectionCase` |
| [RecoverCollectionCase.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections/src/Actions/RecoverCollectionCase.php) | `public function execute(CollectionCase $case): CollectionCase` |
| [RetryCollectionCase.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections/src/Actions/RetryCollectionCase.php) | `public function execute(CollectionCase $case, \DateTimeInterface $nextActionAt): CollectionCase` |
| [ScheduleDunning.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections/src/Actions/ScheduleDunning.php) | `public function execute(CollectionCase $case, \DateTimeInterface $nextActionAt): CollectionCase` |
| [ScheduleReminder.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections/src/Actions/ScheduleReminder.php) | `public function execute(CollectionCase $case, \DateTimeInterface $nextActionAt): CollectionCase` |
| [SuspendCollectionCase.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections/src/Actions/SuspendCollectionCase.php) | `public function execute(CollectionCase $case, string $reason): CollectionCase` |
| [WriteOffCollectionCase.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections/src/Actions/WriteOffCollectionCase.php) | `public function execute(CollectionCase $case, string $reason): CollectionCase` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [CollectionCase.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections/src/Models/CollectionCase.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/module-billing-collections-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-billing-laravel-filament/blob/4743bdfebd1c122e10bf80171d0210ab27e34a54/modules/module-billing-collections-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::middleware(['api', 'throttle:api', 'auth:sanctum', 'ability:billing.collections.read'])->prefix('api/v1/billing/collections')->name('billing.collections.')->group(function (): void {
Route::get('/', [CollectionCaseController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
Route::middleware(['api', 'throttle:api', 'auth:sanctum', 'ability:billing.collections.write', 'idempotency'])->prefix('api/v1/billing/collections')->name('billing.collections.')->group(function (): void {
Route::post('/', [CollectionCaseController::class, 'store'])->name('store');
Route::post('/{case}/promise', [CollectionCaseController::class, 'promise'])->name('promise');
Route::post('/{case}/suspend', [CollectionCaseController::class, 'suspend'])->name('suspend');
Route::post('/{case}/recover', [CollectionCaseController::class, 'recover'])->name('recover');
Route::post('/{case}/retry', [CollectionCaseController::class, 'retry'])->name('retry');
Route::post('/{case}/write-off', [CollectionCaseController::class, 'writeOff'])->name('write-off');
Route::post('/{case}/dunning', [CollectionCaseController::class, 'dunning'])->name('dunning');
Route::post('/{case}/reminder', [CollectionCaseController::class, 'reminder'])->name('reminder');
Route::post('/{case}/credit-control', [CollectionCaseController::class, 'creditControl'])->name('credit-control');
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.
