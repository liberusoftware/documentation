# Automation Core: Next.js presentation plan

<!-- nextjs-plan:generated -->

**Status:** proposed adapter, not an observed npm release. The source entry points below describe reviewed locations/signatures; screen, route and component decisions are implementation targets until the API and UI contracts are verified.

**Adapter group:** `liberusoftware/automation-automation-core`.

**Proposed design identifier:** `module-automation-automation-core-nextjs`. Confirm the actual npm scope/name, exports and peer versions before publishing.

## Scope and ownership

The [domain specification](../features/automation-core.md) owns the intended capability scope. Laravel and the owning modules remain authoritative for permissions, validation, state changes and persistence. The Next.js application owns public routes, session integration and deployment; the adapter contributes components and transport helpers.

This plan is the shared documentation home for **2 existing design spellings/consumer scopes** that map to the same core identity. They reference one adapter plan rather than create competing implementations. Source variants still need compatibility review before a common release.

| Boundary | Observed package reference |
| --- | --- |
| Core | [liberusoftware/automation-automation-core](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--automation-automation-core.md) |
| API | [liberusoftware/automation-automation-core-api](../../../modules/source/liberusoftware--automation-automation-core-api.md) |

## Module surfaces and component contracts

| Capability in the domain scope | Next.js composition target |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow definitions | A focused authorized view or workflow section for workflow definitions; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Versions | A focused authorized view or workflow section for versions; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Triggers | A focused authorized view or workflow section for triggers; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| State | A focused authorized view or workflow section for state; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Runs | A focused authorized view or workflow section for runs; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Variables | A focused authorized view or workflow section for variables; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Schedules | A focused authorized view or workflow section for schedules; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Retries | A focused authorized view or workflow section for retries; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Cancellation | A focused authorized view or workflow section for cancellation; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |
| Compensation | A focused authorized view or workflow section for compensation; define the exact read DTO, permitted command, validation and recovery state from the owning API before implementation. |

Use a list/workspace view only where a domain query exists, a detail/evidence view for an authorized record, and one command form per supported transition. Prefer API-returned permitted actions and explicit field allowlists. Contract/configuration modules can be composed into another workspace instead of receiving artificial resource routes.

## Query and command integration

Observed action/service candidates for the transport review are below. A service method is not automatically a command, an authorized public API or a safe server action; inspect its implementation and calling policies.

| Source action/service | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| [CancelWorkflowRun.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/automation-laravel/blob/68e5f07a67041f8438530c71bc86515cbd11da70/modules/module-automation-automation-core/src/Actions/CancelWorkflowRun.php) | `public function execute(WorkflowRunRecord $run, string $teamId, ?string $actorId = null, ?string $correlationId = null): WorkflowRunRecord` |
| [CreateAutomationCoreResource.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/automation-laravel/blob/68e5f07a67041f8438530c71bc86515cbd11da70/modules/module-automation-automation-core/src/Actions/CreateAutomationCoreResource.php) | `public function execute(string $teamId, string $name, array $payload = [], ?string $idempotencyKey = null, ?string $actorId = null, ?string $correlationId = null): AutomationCoreResource` |
| [PublishWorkflow.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/automation-laravel/blob/68e5f07a67041f8438530c71bc86515cbd11da70/modules/module-automation-automation-core/src/Actions/PublishWorkflow.php) | `public function execute(AutomationCoreResource $workflow, string $teamId, WorkflowDefinition $definition, ?string $actorId = null, ?string $correlationId = null): WorkflowVersion` |
| [StartWorkflowRun.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/automation-laravel/blob/68e5f07a67041f8438530c71bc86515cbd11da70/modules/module-automation-automation-core/src/Actions/StartWorkflowRun.php) | `public function execute(AutomationCoreResource $workflow, string $teamId, array $variables = [], ?string $idempotencyKey = null, ?string $actorId = null, ?string $correlationId = null): WorkflowRunRecord` |
| [TransitionAutomationCoreResource.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/automation-laravel/blob/68e5f07a67041f8438530c71bc86515cbd11da70/modules/module-automation-automation-core/src/Actions/TransitionAutomationCoreResource.php) | `public function execute(AutomationCoreResource $resource, string $teamId, string $status, array $allowedStatuses = ['draft', 'active', 'paused', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled'], ?string $actorId = null, ?string $correlationId = null): AutomationCoreResource` |

The server transport resolves the authenticated actor and tenant/entity membership, calls a fixed configured Laravel origin and validates the response DTO. Every server action/route handler authorizes its invocation; Laravel independently authorizes its operation. Browser input can select a scope but cannot establish membership or change the trusted API origin.

### Record-field review

These are observed storage models and fillable field names, not a browser DTO schema. Review sensitivity, computed values and owner policy; use an explicit API allowlist rather than exposing every model field.

| Source model | Observed fillable fields |
| --- | --- |
| [AutomationCoreResource.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/automation-laravel/blob/68e5f07a67041f8438530c71bc86515cbd11da70/modules/module-automation-automation-core/src/Models/AutomationCoreResource.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |
| [WorkflowRunRecord.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/automation-laravel/blob/68e5f07a67041f8438530c71bc86515cbd11da70/modules/module-automation-automation-core/src/Models/WorkflowRunRecord.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |
| [WorkflowVersion.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/automation-laravel/blob/68e5f07a67041f8438530c71bc86515cbd11da70/modules/module-automation-automation-core/src/Models/WorkflowVersion.php) | No literal fillable array detected; inspect the model and API schema. |

### Route source evidence

The following are literal declaration excerpts. They are not expanded final URLs: group prefixes, middleware, provider registration and host routing must be read together. Target API examples elsewhere do not override these source contracts.

[modules/module-automation-automation-core-api/routes/api.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/automation-laravel/blob/68e5f07a67041f8438530c71bc86515cbd11da70/modules/module-automation-automation-core-api/routes/api.php)

```php
Route::middleware(['api', 'auth:sanctum', 'throttle:60,1'])->prefix('api/v1/automation/automation-core')->group(function (): void {
Route::get('/', [AutomationCoreResourceController::class, 'index']);
Route::post('/', [AutomationCoreResourceController::class, 'store']);
Route::get('/{id}', [AutomationCoreResourceController::class, 'show']);
Route::patch('/{id}', [AutomationCoreResourceController::class, 'update']);
Route::delete('/{id}', [AutomationCoreResourceController::class, 'destroy']);
Route::post('/{id}/transition', [AutomationCoreResourceController::class, 'transition']);
Route::post('/{id}/publish', [AutomationCoreResourceController::class, 'publish']);
Route::post('/{id}/runs', [AutomationCoreResourceController::class, 'run']);
Route::post('/{id}/runs/{runId}/cancel', [AutomationCoreResourceController::class, 'cancelRun']);
```

## Server/client and React reuse

Keep API credentials and session forwarding in server-only exports. A Server Component may load authorized serializable data and compose a Client Component for interaction. Put ordinary event callbacks inside the client boundary; server-to-client props must follow the framework serialization/action rules.

Share framework-independent React cards, tables, labels, formatting and field primitives with Inertia. Keep `next/link`, Next.js navigation, server actions and cache invalidation in this adapter, and Inertia visits, page props and redirects in its wrapper. Reuse domain/API DTOs without importing PHP models or another application's private frontend state.

## State, failures and verification

| Situation | User-facing behavior and integration requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Loading or empty authorized query | Accessible progress/empty copy; preserve filters and avoid displaying stale records from another scope |
| Expired session or denied permission | Reauthenticate or show a scoped denial; discard protected cached data and do not retry as a broader service identity |
| Invalid command input | Preserve safe draft values, announce field errors and use the authoritative API validation outcome |
| Stale record / concurrent change | Reload/review the current version; do not overwrite silently or invent an ETag contract the API does not support |
| Timeout after a write | Query the operation/current record when supported before retrying; an idempotency key works only if the owning API actually stores/enforces it |
| Long-running or partly failed operation | Show a durable operation reference, progress, last error and a permitted retry/recovery action |

Start authenticated reads with explicit no-store behavior until a reviewed tenant/permission-aware caching policy exists. Refresh affected read models after confirmed mutations; pending transport acceptance is not a completed business transition. Recheck access for evidence/export downloads.

Verify the actual supported query/command journeys, invalid and denied paths, tenant switching, stale state, retry recovery, keyboard/focus behavior and secret exclusion from browser bundles. Build/test the packed adapter in a clean consuming Next.js application using its declared versions and API contract. No npm package or application suite was executed by this plan generator.

See the [Next.js standard](../../../standards/NEXTJS.md), [npm lifecycle guide](../../../guides/NPM.md), [API architecture](../../../architecture/API.md), and [shared ownership guide](../../../architecture/SHARED-MODULES.md).
