# Boilerplate: Notifications domain packages

**Composer package:** `module-notifications`
**Foundation specification:** [BOILERPLATE.md](../BOILERPLATE.md)
**Capability:** Templates, channels, preferences, inbox, delivery status, retries, quiet hours, and localization.

## Ownership and implementation plan

This package is the authoritative, presentation-neutral implementation of Notifications. It owns the domain language, invariants, application actions, read models, policies, persistence, events, jobs, contracts, lifecycle, recovery, data classification, and upgrade behavior for this capability.

- Model the bounded context with explicit aggregates, entities, value objects, enums, and lifecycle states; reject invalid transitions inside the domain boundary.
- Expose typed actions for mutations and purpose-built queries for reads. Keep Eloquent models as persistence mappings and never expose private tables to other modules.
- Enforce authorization, tenant/team context, ownership, consent, and field sensitivity consistently across HTTP, UI, console, queue, export, search, notification, and bulk paths.
- Own migrations, constraints, indexes, factories, seeders, retention, export, deletion, configuration, events, jobs, and safe enable/disable/upgrade behavior.
- Make asynchronous work idempotent, retryable, observable, and safe to replay; dispatch local events after commit and document compensation for distributed work.

## Verification and consumer contract

Test domain rules, actions, policies, validation, persistence, tenancy, events, jobs, commands, migrations, upgrades, security, failure recovery, and representative host composition. Add architecture tests for presentation coupling, provider leakage, private cross-module access, and dependency cycles.

API, Filament, Livewire, React, Vue, and Nuxt consumers use only this package's public contracts. See [DDD patterns](../../../standards/DOMAIN-DRIVEN-DESIGN-PATTERNS.md) and [testing](../../../standards/TESTING.md).
