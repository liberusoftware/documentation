# Liberu: Business Workflow Reconciliation Livewire 4

**Existing cross-project implementations:** the [platform reuse guide](../REUSE.md) identifies the observed prefixed/unprefixed package families, namespaces, tables and adoption constraints. This scope is their composition/design home; it does not require a third independent implementation.

<!-- source-reconciliation:start -->
**Source reconciliation:** [design-to-source map](../SOURCE-MAPPING.md#business-workflow-reconciliation). No dedicated package name match was found for this layer in the scanned module manifests. Requirements and examples below describe the target design; the linked source reference records observed metadata and code, and does not certify release availability or implemented parity.

## Canonical one-to-one presentation implementation

**Package:** `module-liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation-livewire`
**Matching domain module:** `liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation`
**Application:** Liberu Business Platform
**Source feature:** [Business Workflow Reconciliation](../features/business-workflow-reconciliation.md)
**Standard:** [LIVEWIRE](../../../standards/LIVEWIRE.md) · [Modules](../../../architecture/MODULES.md) · [API architecture](../../../architecture/API.md)

## 1. Purpose and ownership

This optional Livewire 4 package presents exactly one new Liberu cross-product module. Provide server-driven operational components for this module's states and actions without moving domain rules into UI state. It depends only on the module's public contracts and must not duplicate or replace behavior owned by Accounting, CRM, Billing, Control Panel, Ecommerce, Automation, Maintenance, SAP, CMS, or another existing project.

## 2. Required surfaces

- composition manifest and module capability visibility;
- authorized workflow status, evidence, and failure/recovery states;
- tenant/team/role-aware filtering and denial behavior;
- localization, accessibility, audit context, and operational telemetry;
- explicit loading, empty, stale, validation, unauthorized, forbidden, offline, and server-error states where applicable.

## 3. Boundary rules

- The matching domain module owns invariants, persistence, policies, actions, events, and recovery semantics.
- Consume only documented module/API contracts; never access private tables, models, or another module's internal presentation package.
- Preserve correlation IDs, idempotency, concurrency, audit, tenant context, and authorization outcomes.
- Themes may style documented extension points but cannot change permissions, workflows, or source-of-truth ownership.

## 4. Verification

- Test allowed, denied, wrong-team/tenant, invalid, duplicate, stale/concurrent, timeout, partial-failure, replay, compensation, and recovery paths relevant to the adapter.
- Test package registration, collision boundaries, contract compatibility, accessibility, localization/RTL, security, and production build/render behavior.
- Prove that no existing project module or feature is reimplemented; this package exposes only the new Liberu cross-product capability.

## 5. Definition of done

- Package identity and dependency point one-to-one to the matching new domain module.
- Public routes, props, events, resources, components, and extension points are documented and namespaced.
- CI passes contract, authorization, tenant isolation, accessibility, compatibility, and failure/recovery checks.
- Release notes, migration guidance, runbook, and uninstall/disable behavior are complete.
