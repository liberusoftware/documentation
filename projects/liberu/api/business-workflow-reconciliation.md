# Liberu: Business Workflow Reconciliation API

**Existing cross-project implementations:** the [platform reuse guide](../REUSE.md) identifies the observed prefixed/unprefixed package families, namespaces, tables and adoption constraints. This scope is their composition/design home; it does not require a third independent implementation.

<!-- source-reconciliation:start -->
**Source reconciliation:** [design-to-source map](../SOURCE-MAPPING.md#business-workflow-reconciliation). No dedicated package name match was found for this layer in the scanned module manifests. Requirements and examples below describe the target design; the linked source reference records observed metadata and code, and does not certify release availability or implemented parity.

## Canonical one-to-one presentation implementation

**Package:** `module-liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation-api`
**Matching domain module:** `liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation`
**Application:** Liberu Business Platform
**Source feature:** [Business Workflow Reconciliation](../features/business-workflow-reconciliation.md)
**Standard:** [API](../../../standards/API.md) · [Modules](../../../architecture/MODULES.md) · [API architecture](../../../architecture/API.md)

## 1. Purpose and ownership

This optional API package presents exactly one new Liberu cross-product module. Expose the module's versioned cross-product contract, resources, operations, permissions, tenancy, errors, idempotency, and reconciliation evidence. It depends only on the module's public contracts and must not duplicate or replace behavior owned by Accounting, CRM, Billing, Control Panel, Ecommerce, Automation, Maintenance, SAP, CMS, or another existing project.

## 2. Required surfaces

- composition manifest and module capability visibility;
- authorized workflow status, evidence, and failure/recovery states;
- tenant/team/role-aware filtering and denial behavior;
- localization, accessibility, audit context, and operational telemetry;
- explicit loading, empty, stale, validation, unauthorized, forbidden, offline, and server-error states where applicable.

## 3. Endpoint examples

**Contract status:** use the observed source below for current route/handler/schema evidence. The surrounding module scope is a target design; its feature labels are not request field names. Do not generate a create/update/delete payload or final URL by mechanically copying the design identifier.

No route file was established under the matched module roots for this spelling. That is a source-location observation, not proof that the capability has no API or UI. Review application-owned routes and the public domain boundary before proposing HTTP commands.

A client example is valid only after its exact request/response contract is established. Record required/nullable fields, business units, allowed values, operation identity/concurrency support, result/pagination envelope and recovery. An `Idempotency-Key` or `If-Match` example does not establish server support by itself.

## 4. OpenAPI schema

No machine-readable schema file was found in the indexed `openapi/` or `schemas/` roots of the matched packages. Define a reviewed fragment from the actual public operations; a capability list or unrestricted `attributes` object is not a complete request contract. Application-owned or differently located contracts may need separate mapping.

For the target contract, define stable operation IDs, explicit request/resource/collection/error schemas, allowed audiences/scopes, actor/tenant resolution, field sensitivity, pagination/filter limits, concurrency and retry semantics. Use the real manifest identity and actual route namespace, not a guessed repository-derived package or path.

Validate/bundle the fragment, check supported-version compatibility and generate clients only from the reviewed contract. Retain the source/schema commit or release in client compatibility notes. See the [API architecture](../../../architecture/API.md), [source mapping](../SOURCE-MAPPING.md#business-workflow-reconciliation), and [Composer](../../../guides/COMPOSER.md)/[npm](../../../guides/NPM.md) guides.

## 5. Audience and operation matrix

Expose only explicitly selected operations. Anonymous access is disabled unless the owning capability requires it; customer/partner reads and commands use record/tenant scope, staff actions use the relevant policy, and integrations use a narrow service identity. UI visibility and authentication alone do not establish authorization.

## 6. Implementation strategy

Resolve trusted actor/tenant context, validate the reviewed request and delegate to the public owning action/query. Serialize explicit authorized DTOs; preserve documented operation identity, concurrency and error semantics. Reuse existing owner APIs instead of copying their records or private model access.

## 7. Security, resilience, and observability

Apply record/field policy to lists, relationships, commands, bulk work, jobs and downloads. Use bounded retries/timeouts, durable operation/source references and explicit partial-failure recovery. Redact credentials/protected data while retaining safe request/correlation diagnostics.

## 8. Verification strategy

Verify actual route/schema parity, required input, allowed/denied/wrong-tenant requests, stale/duplicate commands, uncertain outcomes, pagination/field policy and affected owner integrations. Check the declared package/host scripts and supported versions; source/test presence is not a passing-run claim.

## 9. Definition of done

Release only after the complete reviewed request/response/error contract, version compatibility, security and owner invariants, consumer integration, migrations where owned, and operational recovery are verified. Document the actual package identity and source/release evidence in its README and changelog.
