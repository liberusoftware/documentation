# Fraud And Risk Flutter + Dart

<!-- source-reconciliation:start -->
**Source reconciliation:** [design-to-source map](../SOURCE-MAPPING.md#fraud-and-risk). Implementation also lives in the [application tree](../SOURCE-APPLICATION.md); preserve this documented module. Requirements and examples below describe the target design; the linked source reference records observed metadata and code, and does not certify release availability or implemented parity.

**Package:** module-ecommerce-fraud-and-risk-flutter

**Matching API package:** module-ecommerce-fraud-and-risk-api ([contract](../api/fraud-and-risk.md))

## Implementation plan

This adapter presents Fraud And Risk for the Flutter + Dart surface. It owns platform UI, navigation/state integration, device-facing behavior, and client error/recovery mapping; the matching core package remains authoritative for domain rules, persistence, authorization, tenancy, audit, and lifecycle transitions.

- Use sound Dart null safety, typed DTOs, stable Flutter plugins, secure platform storage, and explicit application state models.
- Preserve the API contract, tenant/team context, field visibility, localization, timezone/currency formatting, and server-side authorization.
- Model loading, empty, denied, offline, queued, conflict, retry, and recovery states; make writes idempotent and safe to resume after interruption.
- Support screen readers, dynamic text, keyboard/switch access, contrast, reduced motion, RTL, rotation, deep links, and platform back behavior.
- Document cache classification, expiry/invalidation, native permissions, push/deep-link handling, supported OS versions, and release configuration.

## Verification

Test Fraud And Risk API mapping, authorization outcomes, state transitions, lifecycle interruption, permission denial, offline/retry/conflict behavior, accessibility, localization, and signed release builds on supported platforms.
