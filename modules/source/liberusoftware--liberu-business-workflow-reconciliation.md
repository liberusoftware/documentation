# liberusoftware/liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation: observed package reference

**Evidence status:** extracted from tracked source at the commits below. This reference indexes declared metadata, source callables and persistence files. It does not establish a stable public API, implemented acceptance criteria, successful tests, registry availability or runtime safety.

Liberu liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation module.

## Source locations

| Application | Actual directory | Commit | Reference variant | Test files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| [automation](../../projects/automation/SOURCE-MODULES.md) | [liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-automation-laravel-filament/blob/68e5f07a67041f8438530c71bc86515cbd11da70/modules/liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation/composer.json) | `68e5f07a6704` | [Variant 1](#variant-1) | 2 |

Physical source locations: **1**. Reference variants: **1**. Compatibility symlinks are excluded as separate implementations. Reference variants also include tests, scripts and OpenAPI files, so they can be more granular than the runtime-only [shared comparison](../../architecture/SHARED-MODULE-COMPARISON.md).

Use the manifest identity above for resolution. A `module-...` repository or design identifier may differ. See the [Composer lifecycle guide](../../guides/COMPOSER.md), [npm lifecycle guide](../../guides/NPM.md) and [shared ownership guide](../../architecture/SHARED-MODULES.md).

## Variant 1

Representative: project-automation-laravel-filament, `liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation`. Matching reference files in this variant are indexed once; the location table preserves every consuming application.

### Manifest and registration

| Property | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| Composer name | `liberusoftware/liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation` |
| Composer version field | `1.1.1` |
| Package type | `liberu-module` |
| Module manifest name | `liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation` |

The manifest default is not proof of deployment enablement. Providers, manifest schemas and registration mechanisms differ across packages; inspect the actual host resolver before adoption. Both Composer auto-discovery and module-manager registration may need review when both are declared.

### Persistence and lifecycle evidence

Migrations/settings files are source history, not proof they were applied. Check existing tables, migration records, locks, backfills and recovery before adoption.

### Verification and consumer use

Declared Composer scripts: `{"test": "pest"}`.

Tracked files under `tests/`: **2**. Presence and counts do not establish assertions, coverage or a passing run.

- [tests/Feature/DomainTest.php](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-automation-laravel-filament/blob/68e5f07a67041f8438530c71bc86515cbd11da70/modules/liberu-business-workflow-reconciliation/tests/Feature/DomainTest.php)

Before adoption, verify module enablement, clean consumer resolution, actor/tenant authorization, invalid input, duplicates/concurrency, migration compatibility and failure recovery for the actual call path. Use the owning application/package scripts and supported PHP/framework versions. This documentation extraction did not install, boot, test or release the package.
